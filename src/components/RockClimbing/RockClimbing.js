                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Paintings dating from 200 BC show Chinese men rock climbing. In early America, the cliff-dwelling Anasazi in the 12th century are thought to have been excellent climbers. 
                    Early European climbers used rock climbing techniques as a skill required to reach the summit in their mountaineering exploits. In the 1880s, European rock climbing became an 
                    independent pursuit outside of mountain climbing.</p>
                    <p>Although rock climbing was an important component of Victorian mountaineering in the Alps, it is generally thought that the sport
                    of rock climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in various parts of Europe. Rock climbing evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to a distinct athletic activity.
                    From the middle of the 19th century, the founder of the Alpine Club, John Ball, researched and made known the Dolomites. He was followed there by many other climbers such as Paul Grohmann,
                    Edward R. Whitwell, Michael Innerkofler, Angelo Dibona and Tita Piaz with many first ascents.</p>
